Lips being sealed can be interpreted in two ways: one, they should be always ‘that’ close and two, they should never utter a word to anybody about each other. In 1984, they have to ‘keep their lips sealed’ i.e. keep their romance a secret, as love is considered a crime in the novel’s world. If the government found out about them, they would be punished, as specified in the verses. \n",

Orwell described your only free space as “the few cubic inches inside your skull”, which is the only place what one would consider ‘the truth’ could be hidden. In this case, and throughout the album, Bellamy compares life in today’s capitalist world as very similar to Orwell’s dystopian Oceania, Eastasia or of course, Eurasia. It’s important to notice that Bellamy isn’t an outright anti-capitalist (he defined himself as a left-leaning libertarian), although The Resistance as an album undoubtedly has themes against the wealthy and the privileged. In addition, in a clever wordplay Bellamy mentions here three of the orwellian ministries: Love, Peace and Truth. \n",

      " Source text: George Orwell’s 1984 contains a secret police known as the ‘Thought Police’ whose job was to prevent ‘thinkcrime’, more commonly ‘thoughtcrime’, which was simply any thought or action the totalitarian English Socialism, more commonly ‘Ingsoc’, Party did not approve of, such of love or political interest. Orwell described your only free space as “the few cubic inches inside your skull”, which is the only place what one would consider ‘the truth’ could be hidden. In this case, and throughout the album, Bellamy compares life in today’s capitalist world as very similar to Orwell’s dystopian Oceania, Eastasia or of course, Eurasia. It’s important to notice that Bellamy isn’t an outright anti-capitalist (he defined himself as a left-leaning libertarian), although The Resistance as an album undoubtedly has themes against the wealthy and the privileged. In addition, in a clever wordplay Bellamy mentions here three of the orwellian ministries: Love, Peace and Truth. \n",
